= dcs-api - Digital Combat Simulator API information

This project primarily documents information on how to integrate with
https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com[Digital Combat Simulator]. This
information may be useful, for example, if you want to integrate DCS with a
physical cockpit or add your own extensions or mods to DCS. It seems there
is no official API/programmers guide and bits and pieces of information
is spread over the https://forums.eagle.ru/[Eagle Dynmamics Forums] and
the Internet. Here some of that information is collected and duplicated.

Good starting points are to read Scripts\Export.lua and API\DCS_ControlAPI.html
in the DCS installation folder.
